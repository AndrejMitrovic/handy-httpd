# Examples
Inside this directory, you'll find a series of examples which show how Handy-httpd can be used.

Single-file scripts annotated with a shebang can be run in a unix command-line with `./<script.d>`. On other systems, you should be able to do `dub run --single <script.d>`.

Additionally, there's a `runner.d` script in this directory, which you can run to build and start all examples, so that you're free to interact with them as you'd like.
