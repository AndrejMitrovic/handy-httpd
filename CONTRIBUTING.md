# Contributing to Handy-httpd
This is an open-source project that I work on in my spare time, and I'd greatly appreciate any help in improving the quality, performance, and usefulness of Handy-httpd.

The easiest way to get involved is to:

- Make an [issue](https://github.com/andrewlalis/handy-httpd/issues) if you think you've found a bug or want a new feature added.
- Submit a [pull-request](https://github.com/andrewlalis/handy-httpd/pulls) if you've fixed something or added something on your own. Please note that for large features, it's best to make an issue first to ensure we're all on the same page before you commit a ton of time to it.
